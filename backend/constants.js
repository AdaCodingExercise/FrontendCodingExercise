            "overview": "The common cold is an infection of the upper airways by a virus. Most commonly the nose and throat are affected. A runny nose and a cough are common symptoms. Viruses are spread by droplets that are released into the air in coughs or sneezes. Common viruses are rhinovirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Avoiding infections can help stop the spread of these viruses. For example, people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing. People with a cold usually get better within a week. The symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are very similar. Self-isolation is recommended, and it's suggested to stay at home as per local advice. It's important to avoid workplaces, schools, or other public areas. People should wash their hands often with soap and water and should avoid touching their face. The condition may get worse. If a person feels out of breath, they need to check local guidelines for seeking urgent medical care. Rules and suggested steps may vary as a result of coronavirus disease. For more information, please refer to Ada's medical condition library.",

            "overview": "A depressive episode is a period in which a person has a low mood or feels down. People with this condition feel sad, and have low energy and decreased motivation. Depression affects women more often than men. It most commonly affects people in middle or late adulthood. A depressive episode may be a single event or develop into depression that comes back or stays. To diagnose persistent depression, the symptoms must be present for more than 2 years. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms. Some blood tests may help to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms. Treatment depends on the severity of the depression. It may include counselling, psychotherapy, and antidepressant medications. Many people recover well from a depressive episode. However, in some cases, the symptoms may persist over time. Uncommonly, depressive episodes can also be the first sign of a bipolar disorder.",

            "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the symptoms. Other possible causes of the symptoms should be ruled out. These may include certain medications, infections, or hormonal conditions.

            "treatment": "Treatment depends on the severity of the depression and the affected person's circumstances. It may involve counselling and psychotherapy. Antidepressant medication may also help in treatment. In some cases, the affected person may first need to stay in the hospital during therapy to keep them safe. Exercise, light therapy, and social support groups can also help.",
            "prevention": "It's not possible to prevent depression completely. However, there are some things that may protect people from having depression or a severe case of it. These may include having positive social relationships and reducing stress. Regular exercise can also help.",

            "overview": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a long-term condition that affects the bowel. It's a common condition and affects younger people and women more often. The exact cause of IBS is not completely understood. However, stress and sensitivity to certain foods may contribute. The main symptoms are belly pain, bloating, diarrhoea, and constipation.

            "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and a physical exam. Keeping a food diary may also be useful. It may help people identify which foods make the symptoms worse. A variety of tests may be needed to rule out other possible causes for the symptoms. Endoscopy may be helpful. This involves putting a flexible camera in through the mouth or anus to look at the stomach and intestines. Other tests may include blood tests, X-rays, or CT scans. Breath tests may also be done to test for lactose intolerance.",

Stress can also be a trigger of symptoms. Learning how to manage stress may help some people. Medication may help manage constipation or diarrhoea.",
            "prognosis": "IBS cannot be cured. However, many people learn how to manage their symptoms. The symptoms may improve over time. Most people do not develop long-term complications as a result of the condition."
